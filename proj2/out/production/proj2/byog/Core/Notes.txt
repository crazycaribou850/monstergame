1) Fixed isOccupied() function to detect if room is placed out of bounds

2) Added insertHall function and corresponding tests
    InsertRoom now does nothing except insert room in location.
    Added variable prevprev (used in insertHall method) which tracks 2nd last room created.
    InsertHall is seperate call following insertRoom.

3) Modified create room to only override tile if tile is NOTHING.
4) Fixed bug with random paths in insertHall through adding different case considerations
5) Created generateWorld method and tests
6) Created wallify (and corresponding helper method) method to improve aesthetics

Looks pretty good rn tbh

Exceptions to catch/throw:
1) Creating Room with width/height <=2 (just walls)

1. Assigned variable name to longitude instead of long because long is primitive type

2. RandomUtils are not miscellaneous utilities. They are utilities for randomness.

3.If width/height is even, then true middle will be in between two tiles
 * Current solution: whatever floor division gives (Java / = Python //)
 *  e.g. width = 5
 *   - - - - -
 *   - - - - -
 *   - - - - -
 *       ^ 5/2 = 2 -> center[0] = lat + 2
 *
 *  e.g. width = 4
 *  - - - - - -
 *  - - - - - -
 *  - - - - - -
 *        ^ 6/2 = 3 -> center[0] = lat + 3

4. When generating random room sizes in World.createRoom, I limited
    bounded them between 3 and world.size / 2
    - won't get room sizes larger than half the world
    - eliminates need for Exception 1) ?
